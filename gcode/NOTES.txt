calibration-objects-p5
This was the first test with multiple objects and it showed some stringyness.

calibration-objects-p7
Included a bridging test which failed.  Likely due to lack of cooling during bridging.

cokeI38_50-p9
Coke bottle unstick 1/3 of way through, resulting in a mess.  Bottle was later used to test acetone finishing which resulted in some smoothing (although not smooth) and sagging for the center layer which was not well adhered.

Prusa_i3_Tool_HolderI38_50-p12
This included one useful clip and a fan mount (not yet tested).

FalaclipwireM8I38_50-p13
30 cable clips, very useful.

SunGearCovered-MinecraftCreeperI38_50-p15
Included a minecraft creeper which after cleanup was acceptable.

hollow_cube-stick-testI38_50-p17
Series of 4 cubes to test different surfaces for adhesion.  Tested with kapton strips, abs slurry, gluestick, and hairspray.  The last two performed similarly with some advantage to gluestick.  The first two failed in the 2nd and 3rd layers.

hollow_cube-stick-testI38_50-p18
Two cubes with 8mm brims, to test surface adhesion again.  Compared gluestick and hairspray.  Hairspray came out the clear winner but both were better than any previous cube.

hollow_cube-stick-testI38_50-p19
A repeat of hollow_cube-stick-testI38_50-p18, increasing the temperature from 205 to 215.  This might address stringyness/blobiness resulting from pressure buildup in the nozzle.  Complete failure all around.  The left side sticks more poorly than the right.  Cold spots?

short-cubeI38_50-p20
Trying painters tape again, at 120 with alcohol to remove any coating.  Short burst of hairspray.

hollow_cubeI38_50-layer-height-test-p21
A 24mm cube with varying layer heights for comparison:
 0-5  0.40
 5-10 0.30
10-15 0.20
15-20 0.15
20-24 0.10
The fill pattern also changed significantly.  It turned into a thick-walled honeycomb where the upper layers were not directly above the lower layers.  Not sure what setting causes this.
OVERWHELMING SUCCESS.  The fill did change, and that caused irregularities in the top, but the gradiation in layer height was clearly visible and super smooth at the top.

hollow_cubeI38_50-layer-height-test-p22
This is a repeat of hollow_cubeI38_50-layer-height-test-p21 using even smaller layer heights.
 0-5  0.10
 5-10 0.08
10-15 0.06
15-20 0.04
20-24 0.02
The infill has been changed to density 0.1.  Some consideration was made to reducing the infill layers, but since this is a test about layer height, it didn't make sense to significantly change the time between layers.
